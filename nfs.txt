Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol
originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984,[1] allowing a
user on a client computer to access files over a computer network
much like local storage is accessed.  NFS, like many other protocols,
builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC)
system.  The NFS is an open standard defined in Request for Comments
(RFC), allowing anyone to implement the protocol.
